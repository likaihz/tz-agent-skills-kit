# MCP Tool Server

The original draw.io MCP server. Opens diagrams directly in the draw.io editor via browser.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.js` | Single-file server (stdio transport, vanilla JS, no build step) |
| `src/libavoid-pass.js` | Server-side libavoid edge-routing pass for `open_drawio_xml` (`routing: "libavoid"`) — parses the mxGraphModel XML, runs the vendored routing core (`AvoidRouting.computeRoutes`), writes waypoints back |
| `src/elk-pass.js` | Server-side ELK layout pass for `open_drawio_xml` (`postLayout: "elk"`) — drives the drawio-elk `ElkLayout` bridge over the model `mx-xml.js` parses. Covered by `test/elk-pass.test.js` |
| `src/mx-model.js` | Copy of `shared/mx-model.js` (copy-shared): headless mxGraph model — cells, geometry, `getCellStyle`, the ancestry/reparenting methods (`updateEdgeParents`), `normalizeModel`, the `mxPoint`/`mxConstants`/`mxUtils` globals. The slice of mxGraph the drawio-elk bridge and the edge-parent normalization touch, so both run unchanged without a renderer |
| `src/mx-xml.js` | Copy of `shared/mx-xml.js` (copy-shared): mxGraphModel XML ↔ that model. `transformPages(xml, fn)` parses each page, hands the transform a graph, and writes back ONLY the cells it changed |
| `src/normalize-model.js` | Copy of `shared/normalize-model.js` (copy-shared): the model repairs, driven through `mx-xml.js`. Covered by `test/normalize-model.test.js` |
| `src/elk-engine.js` | Loads + memoizes the drawio-elk bundle (CDN via `cdn-cache.js`, indirect `eval` into the globals) |
| `src/cdn-cache.js` | ETag-revalidated per-user disk cache for the two CDN sources (`ROUTING_CORE`, `ELK_BUNDLE`), atomic single-artifact writes |
| `src/mermaid-elk.js` | Copy of `shared/mermaid-elk.js` (copy-shared): the Mermaid ELK layout selector behind `open_drawio_mermaid`'s `postLayout`. Covered by `test/mermaid-elk.test.js` |
| `src/pages.js` | Local `.drawio` file page access for `list_pages`/`get_page`/`set_page` — regex-scans `<diagram>` blocks (same tag-boundary technique as `libavoid-pass.js`), decompresses/compresses per-page with `pako` as needed. Covered by `test/pages.test.js` (`npm test`) |
| `vendor/libavoid/` | Vendored libavoid-js **node** build + `libavoid.wasm` (see its README). Loaded by path in plain Node — no inlining/base64 (that's the app server's sandbox concern) |

## Tools

### `open_drawio_xml`

Opens draw.io with native XML content. Full control over styling and positioning.

**Model normalization** runs on every call, before any other pass (`shared/normalize-model.js`, driving `MxGraph.normalizeModel` in `mx-model.js`). It repairs three mistakes generated XML carries, and nothing else:

1. **Edge parents.** An mxGraph edge belongs to the nearest common ancestor of its terminals; LLM XML parks every edge on the layer (`parent="1"`), which is what `shared/xml-reference.md` asks for and renders correctly — but lays out wrong, because ELK reads an edge's coordinates in the frame of the node containing it, so a connector between two cells inside one container escapes that container ([#64](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/issues/64)). Fixed the way the editor's own model does it, `mxGraphModel.updateEdgeParents`, rather than making the layout rewrite the hierarchy as a side effect — which is exactly what a layout must not do.
2. **Edges written without a geometry**, which draw.io does not render at all, get the standard relative one.
3. **Containers that would clip a child** are grown to contain it — never shrunk, no child moved.

`MxGraph.normalizeModel` is a port of drawio-dev's `Graph.normalizeModel` (the desktop CLI's `--normalize`), so a diagram repaired here and one repaired by the CLI come out identical — verified cell for cell. Only the changed cells are rewritten; the pass is idempotent, needs no layout engine, and leaves a page it can't parse untouched.

**`postLayout: "elk"`** (optional, with `direction: "vertical"|"horizontal"`) runs a full ELK re-layout server-side before the URL is built — the same `ElkLayout` facade from the `drawio-elk` bundle that the editor's *Arrange ▸ Layout* menu and the app server's `postLayout` use, with the same canonical edge treatment (`ElkLayout.CANONICAL_EDGE`), so the result matches what the editor produces for the same diagram.

Since there is no renderer here, `src/mx-model.js` provides the headless mxGraph slice the bridge reads and writes (model traversal, geometry, `getCellStyle` incl. draw.io's named styles — `swimlane;…` must resolve to `shape=swimlane` or containers lose their title inset). `src/elk-pass.js` parses the XML, runs the layout per `<mxGraphModel>` page, and rewrites only the cells the layout changed; everything else stays byte-identical. Node **sizes are pinned** (`applierOptions.resizeParent: false`, as on the app server): with nothing to measure label text against, the authored width/height stay authoritative and ELK lays out with them.

The ~900 KB bundle is not vendored — `src/elk-engine.js` pulls it from `viewer.diagrams.net` through `src/cdn-cache.js` on first use (`DRAWIO_ELK_URL` overrides the source with a local build for testing an unreleased drawio-elk). Fails loudly, unlike routing: if the bundle can't be loaded the tool result says the layout didn't run, since an unlaid-out diagram is exactly what the caller asked to avoid. A parse problem still fails safe (the page comes back as authored).

**`routing: "libavoid"`** (optional) runs an obstacle-avoiding orthogonal edge-routing pass server-side before the URL is built: vertices stay put, connectors are recomputed to route *around* shapes in clean right angles (draw.io's built-in router has no obstacle avoidance). The routing math is `AvoidRouting.computeRoutes` from the vendored `vendor/libavoid/libavoid-routing.js` — a verbatim copy of the canonical `drawio-dev js/libavoid-js/libavoid-routing.js`, identical to the app server's and the draw.io editor's. Fails safe — any parse/route issue returns the original XML unrouted.

### `open_drawio_csv`

Opens draw.io with CSV data converted to a diagram. Useful for org charts, but CSV processing can fail — prefer Mermaid when possible.

**Avoid** using `%column%` placeholders in style attributes (like `fillColor=%color%`) — causes "URI malformed" errors.

### `open_drawio_mermaid`

Opens draw.io with Mermaid.js syntax. **Recommended default** — handles flowcharts, sequences, ER diagrams, Gantt charts, and more reliably.

**`postLayout: "elk"`** (optional) switches a Mermaid **flowchart** to the layered ELK layout. Nothing is computed here: selecting ELK is a text transform on the source (`withElkLayout` from `shared/mermaid-elk.js` writes the `config: { layout: elk }` frontmatter), and draw.io runs the layout itself when it converts the Mermaid behind the `#create=` URL — `EditorUi.isMermaidElkFlowchart` fires and routes the parsed XML through `applyMermaidElkPostPass`. Non-flowchart types are left alone and the tool result says so (type detection is `mermaidDiagramType`, a verbatim port of drawio-dev's `getMermaidDiagramType`).

### `search_shapes`

Searches the draw.io shape library (~10,000 shapes) by keywords and returns matching shapes with their exact `style` strings, dimensions, and titles — for feeding industry-specific icons (AWS, Azure, GCP, Cisco, Kubernetes, P&ID, electrical, BPMN) into `open_drawio_xml`. The algorithm is the shared `buildTagMap`/`searchShapes` (canonical in `shared/shape-search.js`, copied into `src/` by `copy-shared`), identical to the app server's.

When the local index has no strong match for a query (no result exact-matched every term), results are supplemented live from the draw.io icon service (`icons.diagrams.net` — brand logos and general-purpose concept icons, returned as `shape=image` styles referencing the remote SVG). The merge pipeline is `searchShapesAndIcons` (canonical in `shared/icon-search.js`, also copied by `copy-shared`; covered by `test/icon-search.test.js`): strong local results lead and icons only fill spare slots; weak (Soundex/OR-fallback) local results keep at most half the budget. A full page of strong local results makes no network request; a service failure degrades to local-only results. Override the endpoint with `DRAWIO_ICON_SERVICE_URL` (a self-hosted service base URL, or `off` to disable icon supplementation).

To keep the npm package lean, the ~4.6 MB `search-index.json` is **not** bundled. It is loaded lazily on the **first** `search_shapes` call and cached in memory for the process lifetime; the tag lookup map is built once at that point. An in-repo checkout reads the local `shape-search/search-index.json` (so dev and tests need no network); a published install fetches it from the CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jgraph/drawio-mcp@main/shape-search/search-index.json`, overridable via `DRAWIO_SHAPE_INDEX_URL`). The tool is always advertised; if the index can't be loaded, the call returns a clear error instead of the tool being hidden.

### `list_pages` / `get_page` / `set_page`

Local-file, page-level access for large multi-page `.drawio` files, so an LLM doesn't have to load the whole file into context to inspect or edit one page.

- **`list_pages(path)`** — returns `[{index, id, name, approxSizeBytes}]` for every `<diagram>` in the file. Regex-scans tag boundaries only; never decompresses page bodies, so it stays cheap even for large files.
- **`get_page(path, page)`** — returns the raw `mxGraphModel` XML for one page (`page` is a zero-based index, the page's exact `name`, or its `id`), decompressing it first if that page is stored compressed.
- **`set_page(path, page, content)`** — replaces one page's content with new `mxGraphModel` XML (`content`), re-compressing to match that page's original compression state. Every other page, and the rest of the file, is left byte-for-byte untouched.

Draw.io stores each `<diagram>` body as either plain `mxGraphModel` XML or a base64(`pako.deflateRaw`) blob, independently per page — `src/pages.js` detects which per page (body starts with `<` vs. not) rather than trusting the outer `<mxfile compressed="...">` attribute, since files can mix compression states across pages. Duplicate page names are resolved by erroring with the ambiguous indices rather than guessing (use the index or `id` instead; a page whose name is all digits is parsed as an index, so address it by `id`).

These are the only tools whose arguments touch the local filesystem, so they are deliberately constrained: paths must end in `.drawio` or `.xml` (checked before existence, so arbitrary paths aren't probed); `set_page` content must be a single `<mxGraphModel>` element and is rejected if it contains raw `<diagram>` tags (which would escape the page body and rewrite the file's page structure); decompression is capped at 64 MB against deflate bombs; writes go through a temp file + rename so a crash can't truncate the target. Self-closing `<diagram/>` pages (empty pages) are handled on both read and write.

## URL Generation

1. Content is encoded with `encodeURIComponent`
2. Compressed using pako `deflateRaw`
3. Encoded as base64
4. Wrapped in a JSON object: `{ type, compressed: true, data }`
5. Appended to the draw.io URL as `#create={...}`

## Quick Decision Guide

| Need | Use | Reliability |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Flowchart, sequence, ER diagram | `open_drawio_mermaid` | High |
| Custom styling, precise positioning | `open_drawio_xml` | High |
| Org chart from data | `open_drawio_csv` | Medium |

## XML Reference

The `open_drawio_xml` tool description is loaded at startup from `shared/xml-reference.md` (single source of truth for all prompts). The `copy-shared` script (run on `prestart` and `prepack`) copies it — plus `shared/mermaid-reference.md`, `shared/shape-search.js`, `shared/icon-search.js`, `shared/mermaid-elk.js`, `shared/mx-model.js`, `shared/mx-xml.js`, and `shared/normalize-model.js` — into `src/` so the npm package is self-contained. These copies are gitignored; the `search_shapes` loader imports the helper from the local copy with a fallback to `../../shared/` for in-repo runs. (The two CDN sources are NOT part of copy-shared: the libavoid routing core and the drawio-elk bundle come from `viewer.diagrams.net` through the per-user cache in `src/cdn-cache.js`, with `vendor/libavoid/libavoid-routing.js` as the routing core's last-resort fallback. The ~4.6 MB `search-index.json` is deliberately **not** copied/bundled — it is fetched at runtime; see `search_shapes` above.)

## Coding Conventions

- **Allman brace style**: Opening braces go on their own line for all control structures, functions, objects, and callbacks.
- Prefer `function()` expressions over arrow functions for callbacks.
- See the root `CLAUDE.md` for examples.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Published as `@drawio/mcp` on npm. Run with `npx @drawio/mcp`.

## Releasing

Bump `version` in `package.json`, commit, then run the **Publish Tool Server** workflow (`.github/workflows/publish-tool-server.yml`) — `gh workflow run publish-tool-server.yml`, or with `-f dry_run=true` to pack and verify without publishing. It runs the tests, refuses a version that is already on the registry, and publishes through **npm Trusted Publishing**: the registry trusts the workflow's OIDC identity, so there is no npm token in the repo or on a laptop, nothing expires, no 2FA prompt, and npm attaches a provenance attestation automatically.

This matters beyond convenience: the account's 2FA is `auth-and-writes`, so a local `npm publish` demands an OTP (recovery codes are rejected for writes), and npm is removing direct-publish access from granular tokens in January 2027.

The trust is registered on npmjs.com (Package settings → Publishing access → Trusted publisher) against the repository **and the workflow filename** — renaming `publish-tool-server.yml` breaks publishing until it is updated there too.
